## 1. Subject Confirmation

Literature study concludes: VR helps empathy

In past research, most of the VR scenes constructed were the restoration of real scenes

VR scenes are often used for psychotherapy or vocational training

Few applications of VR technology to eliminate cognitive differences (empathy) between men and women

## 2. Design Questionnaire

A questionnaire was designed to obtain typical scenarios of women encountering sexual harassment

For the subsequent construction of the overall scene

Design two questionnaires, one for men and one for women, and use comparative questions to obtain the differences in how men and women view sexual harassment incidents.

## 3. Analysis Questionnaire

Time to confirm the scene: **dusk or evening**

The overall scene is determined to be **outdoors**

Difference 1: Survey shows that most men don't think looking girls up and down is considered sexual harassment; but the girls think it's sexual harassment.

Difference 2:Most men think that girls have the ability to fight back against sexual harassment???

Women feel that seeking comfort from someone they trust can heal from sexual harassment

The overall atmosphere of the scene is finalized: loneliness, horror, barrenness, desolation

Main color tone: Red, Orange, Gray...


## 4. Design Point Refinement

Surroundings: 18:00-24:00 (evening-night-early morning)

Enviroment: Outdoor?? Public transport???

Ambient sound: Vulgar language, indecent gestures, harassing phone calls...

~~Everything is bigger than normal, especially the presence of NPCs (props)~~


Roadside elements: naked male billboards sexually suggestive statements, random flirtatious passers-by in the distance
