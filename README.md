### Stage I. Subject Confirmation  
Literature study concludes: VR helps empathy  
> ~~In past research, most of the VR scenes were the restoration of real scenes~~    

`don't do real environment` --- interactive scene (No simulation)  

VR scenes are often used for psychotherapy or vocational training  
Few applications of VR technology to eliminate cognitive differences (empathy) between men and women

`Women are sexually harassed` --- Research Event
***

### Stage II. Design Questionnaire  
Two kinds of questionnaires, one for men and one for women   

Questionnaire 1  
- Find out the time, place, and scene when women were sexually harassed  
- What types of sexual harassment are most prevalent
- Feelings of being sexually harassed
- Will it fight back, the way of counterattack?
- How to heal?

Questionnaire 2
- What do men perceive as sexual harassment?
- Why do you think women are more likely to experience sexual harassment?
- Compare the differences between the two questionnaires

**Questionnaire extraction design elements**

Time and Place: `dusk or evening`  `outdoors`

Difference 1:   
> Survey shows that most men don't think looking girls up and down is considered sexual harassment; but the girls think it's sexual harassment.

Difference 2:   
> Most men think that girls have the ability to fight back against sexual harassment???

Tips:   
> Women feel that seeking comfort from someone they trust can heal from sexual harassment

The overall atmosphere is finalizedï¼š
> loneliness, horror, barrenness, desolation
> Main color tone: Red, Orange, Gray...

### Stage IV. Design Point Refinement

**Environment**
> Surroundings: 18:00-24:00 (evening - night - early morning ===>Dynamic Weather System)
> 
> Enviroment: Outdoor?? Public transport???
> 
> Ambient sound: Vulgar language, indecent gestures, harassing phone calls...
> 
> ~~Everything is bigger than normal, especially the presence of NPCs (props)~~  
> 
> ~~Roadside elements: naked male billboards sexually suggestive statements, random flirtatious passers-by in the distance~~

#### ~~Event 1     City Scene~~  
> ~~Harassing phone calls appear over time, family members urge home calls, there will always be some billboards~~

#### Event 2    Outdoor  
`Encounter a threatening thing, a bunch of flies, just leave quickly`

#### Event 3    On the road  
> Passing a single-plank bridge, a very narrow alley,   
> there are ~~moss~~ on the wall (disgusting things), touching it will cause `the handle to vibrate`

#### Event 4   Interaction
> Look up and down==> searchlights  
> Make a sound, there will be more spotlights  
> Fear of being watched: spotlights, the eyes and evaluations of people around

### Stage V. Modeling

Use Blender to model the scene and props   
Export mesh, material, animation... to Unreal Engine

### Stage VI. Interaction Function Realization

**Dynamic Weather System**

Weather changes over time to produce dusk, night, morning
