### Stage I. Subject Confirmation  
Literature study concludes: VR helps empathy  
> ~~In past research, most of the VR scenes were the restoration of real scenes~~    

`don't do real environment` --- interactive scene (No simulation)  

VR scenes are often used for psychotherapy or vocational training  
Few applications of VR technology to eliminate cognitive differences (empathy) between men and women

`Women are sexually harassed` --- Research Event
***

### Stage II. Design Questionnaire  
Two kinds of questionnaires, one for men and one for women   

Questionnaire 1  
- Find out the time, place, and scene when women were sexually harassed  
- What types of sexual harassment are most prevalent
- Feelings of being sexually harassed
- Will it fight back, the way of counterattack?
- How to heal?

Questionnaire 2
- What do men perceive as sexual harassment?
- Why do you think women are more likely to experience sexual harassment?
- Compare the differences between the two questionnaires

### Stage IV. Design Point Refinement

**Environment**
> Surroundings: 18:00-24:00 (evening - night - early morning)
> 
> Enviroment: Outdoor?? Public transport???
> 
> Ambient sound: Vulgar language, indecent gestures, harassing phone calls...
> 
> ~~Everything is bigger than normal, especially the presence of NPCs (props)~~  
> 
> ~~Roadside elements: naked male billboards sexually suggestive statements, random flirtatious passers-by in the distance~~

#### Event 1   City Scene  
Harassing phone calls appear over time, family members urge home calls, there will always be some billboards  

#### Event 2  Outdoor  
Encounter a threatening thing, a bunch of flies, just leave quickly

#### Event 3  On the road  
Passing a single-plank bridge, a very narrow alley,   
there are moss on the wall (disgusting things), touching it will cause the handle to vibrate

### Event 4 
Look up and down: searchlights  
Make a sound, there will be more spotlights  
Fear of being watched: spotlights, the eyes and evaluations of people around

### 6. Test
